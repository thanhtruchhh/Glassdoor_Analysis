# Data Science Job Posting on Glassdoor

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify and analyze the technical skills and qualifications that are necessary for various data-related fields.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis capabilities using the pandas package in Python, accompanied by data visualization techniques.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor?datasetId=1201000&sortBy=voteCount&select=Cleaned_DS_Jobs.csv) and was created by web scraping job postings from Glassdoor's website.

The dataset comes in two versions: uncleaned and cleaned. I only used the first version for the project.

**Uncleaned Data**

  - **index**: A unique identifier for each row of data.
   - **Job Title**: The title of the job posting.
   - **Salary Estimation**: The salary range for the particular job.
   - **Job Description**: A detailed description of the job.
   - **Rating**: The rating of the job posting.
   - **Company Name**: The name of the company offering the job.
   - **Location**: The location of the company.
   - **Headquarter**: The location of the company's headquarters.
   - **Size**: The total number of employees in the company.
   - **Founded**: The year in which the company was established.
   - **Type of Ownership**: Describes the type of ownership of the company (e.g., non-profit, public, private, etc.).
   - **Industry**, **Sector**: The field in which the applicant will work.
   - **Revenue**: The total revenue of the company.
   - **Competitors**: A list of competitors of the company.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the entire data cleaning and EDA process using the uncleaned data.

- **Data**: This directory should contain the uncleaned dataset file (`Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv`).

- **README.md**: This readme file providing an overview of the project and dataset.

## Recommendations

If you're exploring job opportunities in the field of data science, consider the following recommendations based on my analysis of the Data Science Job Posting on Glassdoor dataset:

1. **Location Matters**: Your job search may yield better results in states with higher demand for data scientists, such as California, Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland. These regions tend to have more job openings in this field.

2. **Local Job Opportunities**: Given the limited prevalence of remote job postings in the dataset, it's advisable to prioritize companies located near your geographical area. This approach can enhance your chances of finding suitable positions.

3. **Company Size**: Targeting medium-sized private companies is a strategic choice. These organizations often offer promising career prospects and may be more receptive to hiring data science professionals.

4. **Sector Specialization**: Consider specializing in sectors that exhibit a strong demand for data-related roles. The dataset highlights IT, business services, biotech, aerospace & defense, finance, and insurance as sectors with significant job postings. If you possess skills or experience in these domains, it can be advantageous.

5. **Skill Development**: For those starting their journey in data science, prioritize building a strong foundation in key skills. Learning Python or R, SQL, and Excel is highly recommended, as these skills are mentioned in more than 40% of job postings.

6. **Salary Considerations**: Keep in mind that while the average pay for a data scientist is around $125,000, various factors can influence your salary. These factors include the sector, company location, specific job position, your skills, and knowledge.
